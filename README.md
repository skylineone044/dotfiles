# My Dotfiles

My dotfiles for: zsh (with Oh-My-Zsh), vim and tmux,
but here are my settings for konsole(with fonts and all) and latte-dock aswell.

*setup.sh* links the things to the right places

neovim color scheme is at [https://github.com/skylineone044/nvim-highlite](https://github.com/skylineone044/nvim-highlite)
the setup script automatically installs it as well
